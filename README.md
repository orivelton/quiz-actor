#Generating and serving an Angular project via a development server

ng new PROJECT-NAME
cd PROJECT-NAME
ng serve
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can configure the default HTTP host and port used by the development server with two command-line options :

ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201
